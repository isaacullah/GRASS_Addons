# GRASS_Addons
This is a repository to host development versions of my GRASS Addon scripts. Code here may be buggy and unstable. Please see the official [GRASS Addons repository](https://grass.osgeo.org/download/addons/) for stable versions of many of these scripts.

These scripts can be installed by copying them into your GRASS_ADDON_DIRECTORY. On Linux and Mac, this is usually in your home directory in the "hidden" directory: `.grass7/scripts`. You should then be able to call the scripts from the command line from within your GRASS session. Installing external scripts on Windows is sometimes complicated. You might have to install the scripts into the `C:\Program_Files\GRASS\scripts\` directory.

Notes: On Linux operaing systems, you might have to remove the ".py" extention from the file names, but probably not on Windows. On Linux and Mac operating systems you might have to make the files executable. This can be done from the command line with `chmod 755 'name_of_script_file'`.
